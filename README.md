- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lingqi ZHANG, a Ph.D. at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in parallel programming and related techniques, especially GPU programming. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on:
- - Exploring how the latest GPU hardware influences programming. 
- - - Device-wide synchronization introduced from CUDA 9.0 -> Details pls refer to [PERKS repository](https://github.com/neozhang307/PERKS).
- - - Other features like async shared memory copy and large cache systems -> Details pls refer to [EBISU repository](https://github.com/neozhang307/EBISU-ICS23).
